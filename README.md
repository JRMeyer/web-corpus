# webScraper.py

## Usage

There are three main flags you need feed the script:

```
python3 webScraper.py --seed --verbose --outfile
```

`--seed` is a requirement, it is the seed URL from which the program scrapes

`--verbose` will print out to the terminal which URLs were accepted or rejected

`--outfile` is the file to which the scraped text is saved
